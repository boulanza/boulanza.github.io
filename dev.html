	<img src="me.jpg" width="170px" style="float: left; margin: 5px; border-radius: 50px; margin-top: 11px;"> Hello, my name is Zach Boulanger, and in April 2017 I will be graduating from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and minors in German and Multidisciplinary Design. While I have gathered a lot of professional and academic experience in software development in the application and web environments, I'm most passionate about working in interdisciplinary teams and being able to flex both my creative and technical muscles. I am currently very interested in learning more about entry-level positions with companies that share these ideals.
