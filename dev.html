	<img src="me.jpg" width="170px" style="float: left; margin: 5px; border-radius: 50px; margin-top: 11px;"> Hello, my name is Zach Boulanger, and in April 2017 I will be graduating from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and minors in German and Multidisciplinary Design. While I have gathered a lot of professional and academic experience in software development in the application and web environments, I'm most passionate about working in interdisciplinary teams and being able to flex both my creative and technical muscles. I am currently very interested in learning more about entry-level positions with companies that share these ideals.

			Here at Thomson Reuters Tax and Accounting, I worked on the full breadth and depth of software development. I helped plan projects and budget time for individual work items, implement these features on the front end, back end, and everything in between, and then follow it up afterwards with testing and bug fixes. I've primarily programmed in C#, but also wrote SQL when creating new database schema. We followed the Model-View-Presenter architectural pattern for the front-end, as the code abstraction and familiar pattern helps keep such a large code-base cleaner and easier to understand. Our environment of choice was Microsoft Visual Studio and SQL Server on a Windows machine, while Team Foundation Server was used for version control. Some examples of new features and projects I worked on are adding notifications to the product and adding new features in the payroll section specifically.

		<p>
			I am currently redesigning the website for ArtsEngine, an organization at the University of Michigan focused on the interdisciplinary intersection between the arts and engineering. I first worked at a child organization of ArtsEngine called Living Arts, where I did some minor website development before being hired as a student web designer at ArtsEngine itself to redesign their website entirely. I went through the process of designing wireframes with paper and pencil, higher definition mockups in adobe photoshop, and then a more advanced prototype done with HTML, CSS, and PHP, which I then presented to the organization. I previewed and tested my code using XAMPP. I am now in the process of moving over the old content, finishing up the redesign, and maintaining the current site. I do my programming in Sublime Text and often test the site first in Chrome and use their Developer Tools when needed.
